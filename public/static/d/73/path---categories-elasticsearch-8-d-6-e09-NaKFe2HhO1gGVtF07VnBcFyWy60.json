The interface allows users yo type a freetext query and get a list of database records sorted by relevancy. At it's core, this is a simple problem: if the user types in `Joe`, return all people whose name contains the word `Joe`. And indeed, returning all the `Joe's` in the system is trivial; the problem is that we worked hundreds, possibly even thousands of `Joes`. How do we identify the particular `Joe` that we care about?\n\n","frontmatter":{"categories":["Elasticsearch"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"Elasticsearch"}}
