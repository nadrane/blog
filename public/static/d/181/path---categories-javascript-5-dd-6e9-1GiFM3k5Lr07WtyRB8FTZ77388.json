Since I had already tested my program against a customized suite of tests, the remark got me thinking about how I could further increase my confidence in the correctness of my program. One extremely low cost however effective strategy for identifying faults in software is known as fuzzing.\n\n","frontmatter":{"categories":["Regular Expressions","Javascript","Testing"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"\nI'm currently contracted to create a web service using some data from a third party Angular application.

I converted his code to Javascript and added test specs so that someone can self-guide themselves through the creation of the regex engine. The specs and solution can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nadrane/build-your-own-regex). This blog post walks through my solution.\n\n","frontmatter":{"categories":["Regular Expressions","Javascript","Build Your Own"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"Javascript"}}
