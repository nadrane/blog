I do software consulting work. Here are some things you can hire me for:

- **Search**
  Many clients have troves of data that are within grasp but inaccessible because of inadequate search systems. I can help you optimize your search workflows using [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).

- **Application Development**
  I have extensive experience in the Javascript/[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)/[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) ecosystem and am an expert in [React](https://reactjs.org/).

- **Cloud Architecture**
  I have worked extensively with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)'s broad range of offerings and even have experience implementing completely serverless systems. I can help you navigate this complicated ecosystem.

- **Training**
  If you have a team of developers and need a workshop on [React](https://reactjs.org/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), or [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), I can organize an in-person training.

- **Mentorship**
  I developed curriculum for, taught at, and cofounded the Chicago campus of [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/). Apart from the 100+ students I mentored there, I've since developed a similar curriculum and guided one motivated student towards full employment as a software developer.
