title: Hire Me
---

I do software consulting work. Here are some things you can hire me for

- **Search**
  Many clients have troves of data that are within grasp but inaccessible because of inadequate search systems. I can help you optimize your search systems using [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).

- **Application Development**
  I have extensive experience in the Javascript/[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)/[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) ecosystem and am an expert in [React](https://reactjs.org/).

- **Cloud Architecture**
  I have worked extensively with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)'s broad range of offerings and even have experience implementing completely serverless systems. I can help you navigate this complicated ecosystem.

- **Training**
  I developed curriculum for and taught at Fullstack Javascript at [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/) for a year and specialize in [React](https://reactjs.org/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) training for software companies.
