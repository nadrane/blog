I'm passionate about programming, food and cooking, and the outdoors. I believe in creating communities through technology, and I thrive when solving hard problems.

I live in Bolder, CO and love to meet new people. If you are in the city, we should grab coffee (or tea, my favorite). You can reach me at [nick@nickdrane.com](mailto:nick@nickdrane.com).

I also do [consulting work](/hire-me) for software companies and am happy to chat with you about your projects.
