title: About
---

I've been working professionally as a software developer for 7 years and have been programming for 13. I've worked on small and enterprise systems spanning a variety of platforms and programming languages. I'm passionate about education, creating communities through technology, and solving hard problems.

I live in Chicago. If you are in the city, you should reach out and we should grab coffee (or tea, my favorite). You can reach me at [nick@nickdrane.com](mailto:nick@nickdrane.com).

I also do [consulting work](/hire-me) for software companies and am happy to chat with your projects.
