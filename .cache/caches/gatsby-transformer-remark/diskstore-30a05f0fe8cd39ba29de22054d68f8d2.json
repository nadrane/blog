In essence, it would appear as if the click had worked, but once the animation finished, the DOM would reset itself, undoing my click. I think this is simply how Angular's digest loop reacted to a click at an unexpected time. Unfortunately, Puppeteer provides no functionality to determine when an animation has finished (after all, how would it!). I tried a couple solutions. One entailed a sleep function to wait a couple hundred milliseconds for the animation to finish, but it simply exacerbated the flaky behavior. A second involved executing the click only once the DOM node had a particular class that indicated the animation had finished. At one point, I even tried to disable all animations across the website.
