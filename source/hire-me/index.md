title: Hire Me
---

I do software consulting work. Here are some things you can hire me for

* **Search**
  Many clients have troves of data that are within grasp but inaccessible because of inadequate search systems. I can help you optimize your search systems using [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).

* **Application Development**
  I have extensive experience in the Javascript/[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)/[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) ecosystem and am an expert in [React](https://reactjs.org/).

* **Cloud Architecture**
  I have worked extensively with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)'s broad range of offerings and even have experience  implementing completely serverless systems. I can help you navigate this complicated ecosystem.

* **Training**
  I developed curriculum for and taught at Fullstack Javascript at [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/) for a year and specialize in [React](https://reactjs.org/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) training for software companies.

### Testimonials

#### [Freshwater Advisors](http://freshwateradvisors.com/)

*My consulting group hired Nick to supervise the rebuild of our core web application. The product had a history of difficulties, and Nick's efforts guiding the project - and working closely with my team to get us to the point of self-sufficiency - completely transformed our product and saved us a significant amount of money.*

*It would be easy to be intimidated by Nick's impressive engineering acumen and depth of expertise, but his genuine curiosity, patience, gift for teaching, and commitment to thoroughness make him both a joy to work with and a rarity in tech consulting.*
