Hi!

You probably found this page because my web crawler has been visiting your site. My web crawler is an educational project to help me learn to learn more about distributed systems. It's engineered to be as polite as possible, respecting robots.txt at the subdomain level and limiting requests to any one domain to once every 2 minutes.

If my crawler did anything impolite, please reach out to nick@nickdrane.com. I am happy to blacklist your site if you like.
