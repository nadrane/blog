I've been working professionally as a software developer for 6 years and have been programming for 12. I've worked on small and enterprise systems spanning a variety of platforms and programming languages. I'm passionate about education, creating communities with tech, and solving hard problems.

I live in Chicago. If you are in city, you should reach out and we should grab coffee (or tea, my favorite). You can reach me at [nicholasdrane@gmail.com](mailto://nicholasdrane@gmail.com).

I also do [consulting work](/hire-me) for software companies and am happy to chat with your projects.
