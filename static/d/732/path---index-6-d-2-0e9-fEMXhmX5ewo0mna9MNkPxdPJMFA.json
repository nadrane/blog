{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>At Fraight, we have an <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\">Elasticsearch</a> backed search interface that allows users to type a freetext query and get a list of our partners sorted by relevancy. At it's core, this is a simple problem: if the user types in <code class=\"language-text\">Joe</code>, return all partners whose name contains the word <code class=\"language-text\">Joe</code>. And indeed, returning all the <code class=\"language-text\">Joe</code>s in the system is straightforward; the problem is that we work with hundreds of <code class=\"language-text\">Joe</code>s. We needed a way to sort to the top the particular <code class=\"language-text\">Joe</code> that the user cares about.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h2>A Poor Solution</h2>\n<p>When I worked at <a href=\"https://www.epic.com/\">Epic</a>, we had a search interface that allowed us to look up patients by name, and it suffered the same problem described above. Epic solved this problem by providing additional fields like birthdate or address and used this additional identifying information to pare down the search results. This solution slows down the user's workflow and can be improved.</p>\n<h2>Our Solution</h2>\n<p>At Fraight, we created a solution that just works. The user enters a name, and the system returns 5-10 results, and more often than not, the first two results contain the record the user is looking for. Here's how we did it.</p>\n<p>We needed to customize the score that Elasticsearch calculates for each matched record. For the uninitiated, Elasticsearch's score is an indicator of the relevancy of a particular document (search result). Prior to our scoring customizations, given a query for a name, our Elasticsearch query for <code class=\"language-text\">Joe</code> would pare down a dataset of ~10,000,000 records to ~100 results, but each of the 100 results might have the same score (since they were all named Joe)! Here's how we customized our the Elasticsearch scoring system so that we could more accurately sort the 100 results based on relevancy.</p>\n<h2>Custom Scoring</h2>\n<p>We settled on two attributes that should influence the score of a particular partner:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How often we interact with a partner</li>\n<li>How recently we've interacted with a partner</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's important to know that we have worked with most of the partners in our system minimally. We needed to remove this noise from the search results. Phrased differently, if we regularly work with a particular <code class=\"language-text\">John Doe</code>, we want that partner to appear above all the other <code class=\"language-text\">John Doe</code>s in the search results.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if we have recently interacted with a particular partner, there's a good chance we will interact with them again soon. These partners should rank higher.</p>\n<p>It's important, however, to consider the time since our last interaction. If we interacted with someone yesterday, it's important to rank them higher than an a partner we interacted with 10 days ago.</p>\n<h2>Getting the Data</h2>\n<p>Both of these scoring strategies required us to populate Elasticsearch with information detailing the recency and volume of our interactions with each partner. We were lucky to that we already tracked these data points using a change <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture\">data capture system</a>. All we needed to do was ensure that any changes to the primary datastore would sync with Elasticsearch.</p>\n<h2>Elasticsearch Function Scores</h2>\n<p>Elasticsearch provides <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-function-score-query.html#function-field-value-factor\">function score queries</a>, a syntax that allows the user to modify Elasticsearch's calculated store.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/32332fb7bb6c584ff6f0d9bb24c0ae7f/1dabe/simple-score-query.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 680px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 77.62237762237763%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/32332fb7bb6c584ff6f0d9bb24c0ae7f/4ca7d/simple-score-query.webp 170w,\n/static/32332fb7bb6c584ff6f0d9bb24c0ae7f/515c8/simple-score-query.webp 340w,\n/static/32332fb7bb6c584ff6f0d9bb24c0ae7f/d6460/simple-score-query.webp 680w,\n/static/32332fb7bb6c584ff6f0d9bb24c0ae7f/0d7ed/simple-score-query.webp 858w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/32332fb7bb6c584ff6f0d9bb24c0ae7f/f4d37/simple-score-query.png 170w,\n/static/32332fb7bb6c584ff6f0d9bb24c0ae7f/dee79/simple-score-query.png 340w,\n/static/32332fb7bb6c584ff6f0d9bb24c0ae7f/7ef4c/simple-score-query.png 680w,\n/static/32332fb7bb6c584ff6f0d9bb24c0ae7f/1dabe/simple-score-query.png 858w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"\n          type=\"image/png\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n          src=\"/static/32332fb7bb6c584ff6f0d9bb24c0ae7f/7ef4c/simple-score-query.png\"\n          alt=\"simple score query\"\n          title=\"\"\n          src=\"/static/32332fb7bb6c584ff6f0d9bb24c0ae7f/7ef4c/simple-score-query.png\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n      </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>The above function score query tells Elasticsearch to multiply the calculated score by 1.2 times the square root of the likes field.

Our scoring function looked like this (as a heads up, in the rest of this post I'm going to use my script score own syntax let us focus on what's important):</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">newScore = _score * sqrt(numInteractions + 1)</code></p>\n<p>We wanted partners we've worked with most to rise to the top of the search results. The square root tempers the affect of the <code class=\"language-text\">numInteractions</code> on the score, and the <code class=\"language-text\">+1</code> was to ensure that for partners where <code class=\"language-text\">numInteractions</code> is 0 that we didn't make the <code class=\"language-text\">newScore</code> equal to 0.</p>\n<h3>Introducing an Upperbound</h3>\n<p>The above solution resulted in an overwhelming preference towards certain partners. In realty, we do not value more highly a partner with whom we've interacted 1000 times any more than a partner with whom we've interacted 100 times. Taking this feedback into account, our new scoring function looked like this:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">newScore = _score * (numInteractions &gt; 100 ? 2 : 1)</code></p>\n<p>We effectively created a step function where the original Elasticsearch score is either doubled or left unchanged. This creates an upperbound on the amount that <code class=\"language-text\">numInteractions</code> can influence the resulting score. Originally, we had discussed more complicated techniques like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function\">logistic functions</a>, but the above strategy has worked fine.</p>\n<h3>Incorporating Time</h3>\n<p>I mentioned earlier that when we form a new partnership, there's a good chance we will interact with that partner again soon. The above scoring strategy will ignore these newer partners (since we've interacted with them fewer than 100 times), favoring those we've worked with many times, even if we haven't talked to those partners in months.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we wanted our function to double the original score if we've interacted with a partner today. Afterwards, we wanted the score contribution to decay, such that the original score would be unchanged after 45 days of not interacting with a partner.</p>\n<h3>Deriving the Formula</h3>\n<p>We can create a formula that satisfies this constraint by consulting our high school math book and paging to the section on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#Point%E2%80%93slope_form\">point slope form</a>.</p>\n<p>Starting from</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">y2 - y1 = m(x2 - x1)</code></p>\n<p>where</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">m</code> is the slope,</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">y</code> is the Elasticsearch score multiplier</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">x</code> the number of days since last interacting with a partner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want a line that passes through the following two points <code class=\"language-text\">(0, 2)</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">(45, 1)</code> Plugging into the above equation gives us</p>\n<p>-> <code class=\"language-text\">2 - 1 = m(0 -45)</code>\n-> <code class=\"language-text\">m = -1/45</code></p>\n<p>Let's plug this back into a slight rewrite of the original equation, <code class=\"language-text\">y = mx + b</code>.</p>\n<p>Given that when <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> is <code class=\"language-text\">0</code> we know that <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> should be <code class=\"language-text\">2</code>, we get the following equation:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">y = -(1/45)x + 2</code></p>\n<p>Here is what the equation looks like when graphed:</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/8ca66/graph.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 680px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 41.01040118870728%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAYAAAD5nd/tAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAA30lEQVQoz3WS6RKDIAyEef8H9UC8b1HTfpnGoZ3pj3UJhGw26MZxlKZpJIQg+77Ltm1yHIec5ykxRmWLOWedgpyUHZ9hGKQsS5nnWaZpEkSMEQBWjMLguq5HEDY4EgEF7vtWpIrruurZsizKBnNiudxDRDukk7qunyII2Dq1TBEEYNzgjLspO0vs+14V0tn9Y7MM01naiCNg0XXd1zz+FYwfi7+wc+e9F19VkmWZ2m7bVh8ILopCmTM4z3PNYd+YP4T8ECrxvhKHXQbOBRsyczK2xyBmbrhhz9jyiNd3rRcKe25629W88wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/4ca7d/graph.webp 170w,\n/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/515c8/graph.webp 340w,\n/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/d6460/graph.webp 680w,\n/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/c4056/graph.webp 1020w,\n/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/0a53a/graph.webp 1346w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/f4d37/graph.png 170w,\n/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/dee79/graph.png 340w,\n/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/7ef4c/graph.png 680w,\n/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/7236f/graph.png 1020w,\n/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/8ca66/graph.png 1346w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"\n          type=\"image/png\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n          src=\"/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/7ef4c/graph.png\"\n          alt=\"graphed formula\"\n          title=\"\"\n          src=\"/static/3929faaae9d77d8f286dd1543462ecd1/7ef4c/graph.png\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n      </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>If we only wanted the above function to contribute to our Elasticsearch score, you might assume it would look like this:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">newScore = _score * (-1/45) * timeSinceLastInteraction + 2</code></p>\n<p>There's a small problem. See if you can figure it out by looking at that graph?</p>\n<p>I can tell you that <code class=\"language-text\">timeSinceLastInteraction</code> will never be negative, but what happens when the <code class=\"language-text\">timeSinceLastInteraction</code> exceeds 45 days? What happens when it grows even more? We want an equation that multiplies the score by <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> at minimum.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">newScore = _score * Max((-1/45) * timeSinceLastInteraction + 2, 1)</code></p>\n<p>If we take take the maximum of our equation and <code class=\"language-text\">1</code>, then we can be positive that we will never multiply the score by anything less than <code class=\"language-text\">1</code>.</p>\n<h3>Putting it All Together</h3>\n<p>This is the straightforward part. We need to combine the two equations, resulting in a final form that looks like this:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">newScore = _score * (numInteractions &gt; 100 ? 2 : 1) + Max((-1/45) * timeSinceLastInteraction + 2, 1))</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">(numInteractions &gt; 100 ? 2 : 1)</code> varies between <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">2</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Max((-1/45) * timeSinceLastInteraction + 2, 1))</code> varies between <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">2</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means that we will multiply the Elasticsearch calculated score by a number between <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">4</code>. We achieved our goals.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We favor partners we've talk to many times (more than 100 interactions)</li>\n<li>We favor partners we've talked to recently</li>\n<li>We most strongly favor partners who we've talked to many times and have talked to recently.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additionally, we achieve a couple less obvious but super important goals</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We always factor in the Elasticsearch score. Note that the minimum multiplier is 1. We don't have any data that should allow us to rule certain documents out of the results.</li>\n<li>The Elasticsearch score is never drowned out. This point is subtle but distinct from the above point. We don't want a frequently used partner with the name <code class=\"language-text\">joe stevens</code> to outrank <code class=\"language-text\">joe smith</code> when the query is for <code class=\"language-text\">joe smith</code>.</li>\n<li>No one factor dominates the equation to calculate the resulting score. We consider both total interactions and time since last interaction equally (these could be weighted in a more sophisticated solution).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Other Domains</h3>\n<p>You can apply these techniques to many other domains.</p>\n<p>For example, I suspect that hospital staff are more likely to look up patients who have upcoming appointments, a same-day appointment, or who have recently finished an appointment. You could write a function like the one we used to factor in the recency of interaction with our partners</p>\n<p>Or suppose you run an event website or Ticketmaster Eventbrite.
