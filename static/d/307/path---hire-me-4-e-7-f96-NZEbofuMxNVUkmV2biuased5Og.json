Here are some things you can hire me for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Search</strong>\nMany clients have troves of data that are within grasp but inaccessible because of inadequate search systems. I can help you optimize your search workflows using <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch\">Elasticsearch</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Application Development</strong>\nI have extensive experience in the Javascript/<a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">Typescript</a>/<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Nodejs</a> ecosystem and am an expert in <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cloud Architecture</strong>\nI have worked extensively with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">AWS</a>'s broad range of offerings and even have experience implementing completely serverless systems. I can help you navigate this complicated ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Training</strong>\nIf you have a team of developers and need a workshop on <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>, <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">NodeJS</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch\">Elasticsearch</a>, I can organize an in-person training.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mentorship</strong>\nI developed curriculum for, taught at, and cofounded the Chicago campus of <a href=\"https://www.fullstackacademy.com/\">Fullstack Academy</a>. Apart from the 100+ students I mentored there, I've since developed a similar curriculum and guided one motivated student towards full employment as a software developer.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please reach out at me at <a href=\"mailto:nick@nickdrane.com\">nick@nickdrane.com</a> for rates and timelines.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>My consulting group hired Nick to supervise the rebuild of our core web application. The product had a history of difficulties, and Nick's efforts guiding the project - and working closely with my team to get us to the point of self-sufficiency - completely transformed our product and saved us a significant amount of money.</em></p>\n<p><em>It would be easy to be intimidated by Nick's impressive engineering acumen and depth of expertise, but his genuine curiosity, patience, gift for teaching, and commitment to thoroughness make him both a joy to work with and a rarity in tech consulting.</em> â€” <strong>David Machajewski</strong>, Technology Lead, <a href=\"http://freshwateradvisors.com/\">Freshwater Advisors</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hire Me"}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Hire Me"}}
