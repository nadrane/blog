One common statement you will often read is that all state in React should be immutable, and this practice is justified as necessary for performance reasons. This statement is entirely true, but it only tells half the truth. Immutability alone will not yield any performance gains in React (it'll actually make things slower).</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h2>The Quick Answer</h2>\n<p>You can reap the gains from immutable state in React if you inherit from <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent\">React.PureComponent</a> instead of <code class=\"language-text\">React.Component</code></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">MyComponent</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">PureComponent</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token operator\">...</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2>A Broader Perspective</h2>\n<p>So why does the above code work? That requires a little bit of knowledge about the rendering process.</p>\n<h2>Virtual DOM</h2>\n<p>A component's <code class=\"language-text\">render</code> function returns a tree of React elements, also known as the virtual DOM. This data structure is a representation of the browser's DOM that React can manipulate in a performant way. In essence, it's a 1-1 mapping to the browser DOM.</p>\n<p>Whenever state or props change, instead of updating the browser DOM directly, React will call the <code class=\"language-text\">render</code> function of the updated component, getting its new virtual DOM, and it will compare that virtual DOM to the previous render tree (aka the old virtual DOM). This comparison process (known as reconciliation) allows it to identify the minimum set of changes that need to be made to the browser DOM, allowing for for massive performance gains. If the two trees are identical, then no changes need to be made to the UI.</p>\n<h2>Should a Component Re-render</h2>\n<p>When <code class=\"language-text\">setState</code> is called on a component, that component (and all of the components it renders) go through a two step process for React determine if the UI should update.</p>\n<p>Before the virtual DOM is rendered, React first runs a component's <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate\">shouldComponentUpdate</a> lifecycle method</p>\n<h2>shouldComponentUpdate</h2>\n<p>It is your choice to implement this method. It takes as parameters the new state and props and should return a boolean indicating whether the component should re-render. React will only proceed with re-rendering if you return <code class=\"language-text\">true</code> from this function. By default, <code class=\"language-text\">shouldComponentUpdate</code> always returns <code class=\"language-text\">true</code>.</p>\n<p>Let's look at a simple example</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Counter</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">React<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>Component</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token function\">constructor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>state <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      counter<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token function\">shouldComponentUpdate</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">nextProps<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> nextState</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// We are comparing the state before setState</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// is called to the state after it is called.</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// This component will only re-render if</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// state.counter changes</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>state<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>counter <span class=\"token operator\">!==</span> nextState<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>counter<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token function\">render</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>span<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>state<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>counter<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>span<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Currently <code class=\"language-text\">Counter</code> will only re-render if <code class=\"language-text\">state.counter</code> changes. Suppose we remove the <code class=\"language-text\">shouldComponentUpdate</code> above, is there another circumstance where <code class=\"language-text\">Counter</code>' re-renders? It would re-render if a component that renders <code class=\"language-text\">Counter</code> re-renders! It does not matter that <code class=\"language-text\">Counter</code>'s render function does not depend on props!</p>\n<p>So, when <code class=\"language-text\">shouldComponentUpdate</code> returns <code class=\"language-text\">true</code>, React begins the second part of the re-render process, the part where it invokes the render function, generating its virtual DOM. It will then compare that render tree to the old virtual DOM. In the scenario above, these two trees will always be identical (after all, the component doesn't even have a way to change state), and the entire operation will a be waste CPU cycles.</p>\n<p>If <code class=\"language-text\">shouldComponentUpdate</code> returns <code class=\"language-text\">false</code>, we inform React that a re-render will not be necessary, sparing it an unnecessary to call a component's render function and the comparison of the render trees.</p>\n<h2>React.pureComponent</h2>\n<p>Writing <code class=\"language-text\">shouldComponentUpdate</code> is sometimes a tedious task, and React supplies a helper to handle a very common <code class=\"language-text\">shouldComponentUpdate</code> scenario. I mentioned <code class=\"language-text\">React.pureComponent</code> above.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">MyComponent</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">PureComponent</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token operator\">...</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">React.pureComponent</code> is a handy class that we can inherit from that implements <code class=\"language-text\">shouldComponentUpdate</code> as a shallow comparison across the old props and new props (or the old state and new state). If there are no <em>shallow</em> differences between these objects, then <code class=\"language-text\">shouldComponentUpdate</code> will return false, and the virtual DOM's re-rendering process can be skipped entirely, resulting in potentially enormous performance savings.</p>\n<h2>Why Does Immutability Matter?</h2>\n<p>Immutability matters because <code class=\"language-text\">React.pureComponent</code> is going to do shallow comparisons against the prop and state objects. And, as you hopefully know, a shallow comparison's referential equality checks will only yield the expected results if immutability is respected.</p>\n<p>If you are not properly respecting immutability, then you are going to run into scenarios where your components fail to re-render when they actually should. A failure to respect immutability will cause a shallow comparison to return false (meaning <code class=\"language-text\">shouldComponentUpdate</code> returns false) because the old props and new props (or the old state and new state) reference the same object in memory, despite the fact that props/state changed.</p>\n<p>When used carefully however, <code class=\"language-text\">React.pureComponent</code> can yield enormous performance improvements at almost no cost. All you need to do is inherit your components from <code class=\"language-text\">React.pureComponent</code> instead of <code class=\"language-text\">React.Component</code> and respect immutability when changing state.</p>\n<p><em>If you have React performance problems, I do <a href=\"/hire-me\">consulting</a> work and am currently looking for new clients.
